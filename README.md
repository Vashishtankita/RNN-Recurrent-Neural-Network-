# RNN Model for Sequence Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sequence data analysis. 

## The notebook includes:
- Data Preprocessing: Steps to clean and prepare sequence data for modeling.
- Model Architecture: Construction of an RNN using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Training and Optimization: Model training on a sequence dataset with visualization of learning metrics.
- Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using relevant metrics.
= Visualization: Graphical representation of results to better understand model behavior.

The notebook serves as an educational resource for understanding RNNs and can be adapted for various sequence-based tasks such as time series forecasting, language modeling, or sequence classification.

- Requirements
  - Python 3.x
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch
Other dependencies listed in the notebook

Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt the code for your projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
